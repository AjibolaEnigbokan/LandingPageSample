        <h2>A Safer Place , for both children and Parents</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="main-body"> 
      <p>
         Behind the visible destruction caused by the Ukraine conflict, there 's an invisible cost. It's the mental toll on more than 7.5 million Ukrainian children.Faced with multiple traumas of violence, displacement, and separation from , or loss of , their loved ones, these children may develop mental health issues that will persist into adulthood. A Safer Place is  here to  give them strength and hope.
      </p>
      <p>
        Without the right support,children from conflict areas experience high rates of mental disorders, including PTSD , depression, anxiety, self-harm and suicide.And sadly, such acute mental health problems are likely to persist even afer the  violence has stopped.

       <h2>What can a Safer Place do for you ?</h2>
       <p>
        Research from previous conflicts has shown that the most effective psychological interventions are those that strengthen the relationships btween Parents or carers and their children.
        <p>Based on this, we 've developed A safer Place to offer:</p>
        <ul>
            <li> simple therapeutic exercises for child and parent to do together.These are designed in a playful and engaging format, so children will enjoy doing them without being pressured by parents to do so.</li>
            <li> a Parents' Guide which provides extra tips about how to guide children through these difficult times.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The overarching aim of the app is to strenthen the relationship between parents and children, because this relationship is the most important factor that will help children get through these difficult times.

     <h2>   How a Safer Place was born</h2>
        <p>
        The seeds of this project were sown when Larisa Rybyk, President of the Ukraine Psychology Association,contacted Apart of me co-founder Louis Weinstock after she came across his work on childhood loss. Larisa lost her husband during the fighting in Ukraine in 2014.
        </p>
        <p>
        This prompted her interest in helping children cope with bereavement and as a result she set up an organisation in Ukraine to support children and their carers affected by this issue.
        </p>
        <p>
        Now , Larisa has been streaming on Facebook and Youtube every day, trying to offer psychological advice to parents,carers and other mental health professionals. She has told us that the burden she  and other mental health professionals in Ukraine are carrying is devastating and the need is overwhelming.
